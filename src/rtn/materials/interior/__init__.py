class Framing:
    """Interior framing materials.

    The two most common costs associated with framing are finishing an
    interior space and building new construction. This class represents
    framing an *interior space*, e.g., finishing an unfinished space or
    adding partitions within rooms.

    A basic wall consists of three parts:
        1. Bottom Plate := A 2x4 piece of lumber running
            horizontally along the bottom of the wall.
        2. Top Plates := Two 2x4 pieces of lumber running horizontally
            along the top of the wall.
        3. Studs := 2x4 pieces of lumber running vertically every 16".
