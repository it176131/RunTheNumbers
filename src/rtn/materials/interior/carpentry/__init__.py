"""Carpentry can make or break a house.

Great carpentry makes a house feel well put together, while poor
carpentry will make a buyer (or renter) question every part of the
renovation. A good carpenter can serve in many different roles and can
replace a lot of other contractors.

But other than framing and decks, the bread and butter of carpentry
work consists of things like door installations, window installations,
and finish trim work. These are renovation tasks you'll likely have to
perform in every one of your houses, so find a good carpenter sooner
rather than later, and you'll find your renovations going more quickly
and more smoothly than you can imagine. Bring in a bad carpenter, and
all you'll find is frustration and a questionable looking renovation.

This ``carpentry`` package will holld the bread-and-butter carpentry
tasks:
    - Install doors
    - Install windows
    - Finish trim
