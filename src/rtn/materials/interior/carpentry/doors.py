"""Ensure that every door works properly and as expected.

Verify the following:
    - Does the door open and close without obstructions?
    - Does the door latch properly without unnecessary force?
    - Does the door open in the expected direction?

If the existing doors are old or beat up, replace all the doors in the
house. When purchasing doors, you have the option of purchasing just
the door slab (the part that opens and closes) or a pre-hung door (the
slab attached to the doorjamb). While many investors are happy to save
a little money by just buying the slab, replacing a slab instead of the
entire jamb can be more work for your carpenter. Additionally, you'll
often end up paying extra to fix doors that aren't plumb or don't lock
properly.
