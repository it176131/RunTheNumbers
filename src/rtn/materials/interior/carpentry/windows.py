"""Ensure that every window works properly and as expected.

Verify the following:
    - Does it open smoothly and easily?
    - Does it remain open without assistance?
    - Does it close and latch without any unnecessary force?
    - Are the panes of glass free from cracks and moisture?
    - Are there any gaps or openings around the window?

Windows come in all different shapes, sizes, and styles. It is highly
recommended you spend some time looking at different types of windows
and getting a feel for the style of windows that are typical in the
houses you plan to renovate.
